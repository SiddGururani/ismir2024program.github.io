7,Google,Gold,chrisdonahue@google.com,"For nearly a decade, our teams have been exploring [how artificial intelligence (AI) can support the creative process](https://magenta.withgoogle.com/blog/2016/06/01/welcome-to-magenta/), building tools that empower enthusiasts and professionals to discover new forms of creative expression.

Over the past year, we’ve been working in close collaboration with partners across the music industry through our [Music AI Incubator](https://blog.youtube/inside-youtube/partnering-with-the-music-industry-on-ai/) and more. Their input has been guiding our state-of-the-art generative music experiments, and helping us ensure that our new generative AI tools responsibly open the doors of music creation to everyone.

Recently, in partnership with [Google Labs](https://blog.google/technology/ai/jacob-collier-labs-sessions), we released a reimagined experience for [MusicFX DJ](http://labs.google/musicfx) that makes it easier for anyone to generate music, interactively, in real time.

We've also recently released updates to our music AI toolkit, called [Music AI Sandbox](https://blog.google/technology/ai/google-generative-ai-veo-imagen-3/), and highlighted our latest AI music technologies in [YouTube’s Dream Track](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/transforming-the-future-of-music-creation/), a suite of experiments that creators can use to generate high-quality instrumentals for their Shorts and videos.

To learn more about our recent efforts in music AI, [please see this blog post](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/new-generative-ai-tools-open-the-doors-of-music-creation/), and look out for future job openings at [Google DeepMind](https://www.deepmind.com/careers) and [Google Research](https://research.google/careers/).",,https://www.youtube.com/embed/y7gKlzvg8xk,"Careers at Google DeepMind: [https://www.deepmind.com/careers](https://www.deepmind.com/careers)<br/>
