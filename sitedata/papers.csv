1,3,5,5,Remote,FALSE,On the validity of employing ChatGPT for distant reading of music similarity,"In this work we explore whether large language models (LLM) can be a useful and valid tool for music knowledge discovery. LLMs offer an interface to enormous quantities of text and hence can be seen as a new tool for 'distant reading', i.e. the computational analysis of text including sources about music. More specifically we investigated whether ratings of music similarity, as measured via human listening tests, can be recovered from textual data by using ChatGPT. We examined the inferences that can be drawn from these experiments through the formal lens of validity. We showed that correlation of ChatGPT with human raters is of of moderate positive size but also lower than the average human inter-rater agreement. By evaluating a number of threats to validity and conducting additional experiments with ChatGPT, we were able to show that especially construct validity of such an approach is seriously compromised. The opaque black box nature of ChatGPT makes it close to impossible to judge the experiment's construct validity, i.e. the relationship between what is meant to be inferred from the experiment, which are estimates of music similarity, and what is actually being measured. As a consequence the use of LLMs for music knowledge discovery cannot be recommended.",Arthur Flexer,Arthur Flexer (Johannes Kepler University Linz)*,"Flexer, Arthur*","Evaluation, datasets, and reproducibility","Evaluation, datasets, and reproducibility -> evaluation methodology; Evaluation, datasets, and reproducibility -> reproducibility; MIR fundamentals and methodology -> web mining, and natural language processing; MIR tasks -> similarity metrics; Philosophical and ethical discussions -> philosophical and methodological foundations",,,,,No,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dA6YiGRw7WLmcSBG-dCbmqGRjp7DpgnE/view?usp=sharing,,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XuSiWBgkUfBCnZLa-s5uAkZIua7E-p0C/view?usp=drive_link,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VAG-uC-9QPHuPzJsxziqRpipsaG-LYLI/view?usp=sharing,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bDKJUha7CfprIh1jVxLcMZ1aUzb7_kJK/view?usp=drive_link,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iebn1lBmmhCCCeFtp1VsaZyHqPVmCDBA/view?usp=drive_link,,

While previous research has validated the efficacy of compound tokens in music sequence modeling, predicting all sub-tokens simultaneously can lead to suboptimal results as it may not fully capture the interdependencies between them. We introduce the Nested Music Transformer (NMT), an architecture tailored for decoding compound tokens autoregressively, similar to processing flattened tokens, but with low memory usage. The NMT consists of two transformers: the main decoder that models a sequence of compound tokens and the sub-decoder for modeling sub-tokens of each compound token. The experiment results showed that applying the NMT to compound tokens can enhance the performance in terms of better perplexity in processing various symbolic music datasets and discrete audio tokens from the MAESTRO dataset.",Dasaem Jeong,Jiwoo Ryu (Sogang University); Hao-Wen Dong (University of Michigan); Jongmin Jung (Sogang University); Dasaem Jeong (Sogang University)*,"Ryu, Jiwoo; Dong, Hao-Wen; Jung, Jongmin; Jeong, Dasaem*",MIR tasks -> music generation,Knowledge-driven approaches to MIR -> machine learning/artificial intelligence for music; MIR fundamentals and methodology -> symbolic music processing,,,,,No,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1E8CTFJvSUaksQAHwn5DzFUtPTiuSNZ4L/view?usp=share_link,,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1d4vhwOeI7Ve1w0niVr5Y-qRko_ONQcoN/view?usp=share_link,https://drive.google.com/file/d/19ZkRhN2wiJdL1LnQt8dfOMXD__2YV6LW/view?usp=sharing,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ulzf3JND3fCeQwGLr8ueKujOh5F-arSI/view?usp=sharing,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zpIzBSfRxyU4f4PIJR_kc6hxOb41Dud7/view?usp=sharing,,

To achieve high temporal accuracy, synchronization approaches integrate onset-related information extracted from music recordings using either traditional signal processing techniques or exploiting symbolic representations obtained by data-driven automatic music transcription (AMT) approaches. In line with this research direction, our paper introduces a high-resolution synchronization approach that combines recent AMT techniques with traditional synchronization methods. Rather than relying on the final symbolic AMT results, we show how to exploit raw onset and frame predictions obtained as intermediate outcomes from a state-of-the-art AMT approach. Through extensive evaluations conducted on piano recordings under varied acoustic conditions across different transcription models, audio features, and dynamic time warping variants, we illustrate the advantages of our proposed method in both audio–audio and audio–score synchronization tasks. Specifically, we emphasize the effectiveness of our approach in aligning historical piano recordings with poor audio quality.

12,1,1,18,San Francisco,FALSE,Learning Multifaceted Self-Similarity over Time and Frequency for Music Structure Analysis,"This paper describes a deep learning method for music structure analysis (MSA) that aims to split a music signal into temporal segments and assign a function label (e.g., intro, verse, or chorus) to each segment. The computational base for MSA is a spectro-temporal representation of input audio such as the spectrogram, where the compositional relationships of the spectral components provide valuable clues (e.g., chords) to the identification of structural units. However, such implicit features might be vulnerable to local operations such as convolution and pooling operations. In this paper, we hypothesize that the self-attention over the spectral domain as well as the temporal domain plays a key role in tackling MSA. Based on this hypothesis, we propose a novel MSA model built on the Transformer-in-Transformer architecture that alternately stacks spectral and temporal self-attention layers. Experiments with the Beatles, RWC, and SALAMI datasets showed the superiority of the dual-aspect self-attention. In particular, the differentiation between spectral and temporal self-attentions can provide extra performance gain.

Despite its growing popularity, OMR is still confined to settings where the target scores are similar in both musical context and visual presentation to the data used for training the model. The common scenario, therefore, involves manually annotating data for each specific case, a process that is not only labor-intensive but also raises concerns regarding practicality. We present a methodology based on training a neural model with synthetic images, thus reducing the difficulty of obtaining labeled data. As sheet music renderings depict regular visual characteristics compared to scores from real collections, we propose an unsupervised neural adaptation approach consisting of loss functions that promote alignment between the features learned by the model and those of the target collection while preventing the model from converging to undesirable solutions. This unsupervised adaptation bypasses the need for extensive retraining, requiring only the unlabeled target images.

Although there have been attempts to accelerate the iterative procedure, high-quality TTA systems remain inefficient due to the hundreds of iterations required in the inference phase and large amount of model parameters. To address these challenges, we propose SpecMaskGIT, a light-weight, efficient yet effective TTA model based on the masked generative modeling of spectrograms. First, SpecMaskGIT synthesizes a realistic 10 s audio clip in less than 16 iterations, an order of magnitude less than previous iterative TTA methods. As a discrete model, SpecMaskGIT outperforms larger VQ-Diffusion and auto-regressive models in a TTA benchmark, while being real-time with only 4 CPU cores or even 30× faster with a GPU.

103,2,4,14,San Francisco,FALSE,TheGlueNote: Learned Representations for Robust and Flexible Note Alignment,"Note alignment refers to the task of matching individual notes of two versions of the same symbolically encoded piece. Methods addressing this task commonly rely on sequence alignment algorithms such as Hidden Markov Models or Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) applied directly to note or onset sequences. While successful in many cases, such methods struggle with large mismatches between the versions. In this work, we learn note-wise representations from data augmented with various complex mismatch cases, e.g. repeats, skips, block insertions, and long trills. At the heart of our approach lies a transformer encoder network --- TheGlueNote --- which predicts pairwise note similarities for two 512 note subsequences. We postprocess the predicted similarities using flavors of weightedDTW and pitch-separated onsetDTW to retrieve note matches for two sequences of arbitrary length. Our approach performs on par with the state of the art in terms of note alignment accuracy, is considerably more robust to version mismatches, and works directly on any pair of MIDI files.",Silvan Peter,Silvan David Peter (JKU)*; Gerhard Widmer (Johannes Kepler University),"Peter, Silvan*; Widmer, Gerhard","MIR tasks -> alignment, synchronization, and score following",MIR fundamentals and methodology -> symbolic music processing,,,,,No,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GHRxv4pvcpny1pO3Lgx1W1u7kbGoUXnn/view?usp=sharing,,https://drive.google.com/file/d/12FVcGsJpZaS3qKKGy82vNAFXsaaoTm_9/view?usp=sharing,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PfmicdgUqlBQIlc7QFRllz3Km0qc3w_D/view?usp=sharing,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CcnPsI0Fq-S-7zkqwYY6WIRd5K3wrNAn/view?usp=share_link,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aAlxzvZpTkBq7dEnpPFDXIyUMlq-LFNm/view?usp=share_link,,

Existing approaches mainly employ supervised learning and the training demands strongly-aligned and paired song-to-piano data, which is built by remapping piano notes to song audio. This would, however, result in the loss of piano information and accordingly cause inconsistencies between the original and remapped piano versions. To overcome this limitation, we propose a transfer learning approach that pre-trains our model on piano-only data and fine-tunes it on weakly-aligned paired data constructed without note remapping. During pre-training, to guide the model to learn piano composition concepts instead of merely transcribing audio, we use an existing lead sheet transcription model as the encoder to extract high-level features from the piano recordings. The pre-trained model is then fine-tuned on the paired song-piano data to transfer the learned composition knowledge to the pop song domain.

In recent years, APT has relied on supervised deep learning, which demands a large amount of labeled data that is often limited. This paper introduces a semi-supervised approach to APT, leveraging unlabeled data with techniques originally introduced in computer vision (CV): pseudo-labeling, consistency regularization, and distribution matching. The idea of pseudo-labeling is to use the current model for producing artificial labels for unlabeled data, and consistency regularization makes the model's predictions for unlabeled data robust to augmentations.

A relevant discussion and related technical challenge is the potential replication and plagiarism of the training set in AI-generated music, which could lead to misuse of data and intellectual property rights violations. To tackle this issue, we present the Music Replication Assessment (MiRA) tool: a model-independent open evaluation method based on diverse audio music similarity metrics to assess data replication. We evaluate the ability of five metrics to identify exact replication by conducting a controlled replication experiment in different music genres using synthetic samples. Our results show that the proposed methodology can estimate exact data replication with a proportion higher than 10%.

However, combining loops requires a nuanced understanding of musical compatibility that can be difficult to learn and time-consuming. This study concentrates on the 'vertical problem' of music loop compatibility, which pertains to layering different loops to create a harmonious blend. The main limitation to applying deep learning in this domain is the absence of a large, high-quality, labeled dataset containing both positive and negative pairs. To address this, we synthesize high-quality audio from multi-track MIDI datasets containing independent instrument stems, and then extract loops to serve as positive pairs. This provides models with instrument-level information when learning compatibility. Moreover, we improve the generation of negative examples by matching the key and tempo of candidate loops, and then employing AutoMashUpper to identify incompatible loops. Creating a large dataset allows us to introduce and examine the application of Transformer architectures for addressing vertical loop compatibility. Experimental results show that our method outperforms the previous state-of-the-art, achieving an 18.6\% higher accuracy across multiple genres.

We evaluate their predictive capabilities against a series of baselines including out-of-domain (BERT fine-tuned on MFT-annotated social media texts) and zero-shot (GPT-4) classification. The proposed models yielded the best accuracy across experiments, with an average F1 weighted score of 0.8. This performance is, on average, 5% higher than out-of-domain and zero-shot models. When examining precision in binary classification, the proposed models perform on average 12% higher than the baselines.

Despite their empirical success, however, little is known about the influence of key design choices on the quality of music-text representations learnt through this framework. In this work, we expose these design choices within the constraints of limited data and computation budgets, and establish a more solid understanding of their impact grounded in empirical observations along three axes: the choice of base encoders, the level of curation in training data, and the use of text augmentation. We find that data curation is the single most important factor for music-text contrastive training in resource-constrained scenarios. Motivated by this insight, we introduce two novel techniques, Augmented View Dropout and TextSwap, which increase the diversity and descriptiveness of text inputs seen in training.

While the importance of temporal alignment varies across different contexts, achieving precise temporal synchronization is a prominent goal in musical performances. Musicians often incorporate expressive timing variations, which require precise control over timing and synchronization, particularly in ensemble performance. This is crucial because both deliberate expressive nuances and accidental timing deviations can affect the overall timing of a performance. This discussion prompts the question of how musicians adjust their temporal dynamics to achieve synchronization within an ensemble. This paper introduces a novel feedback correction model based on the Kalman Filter, aimed at improving the understanding of interpersonal timing in ensemble music performances.

As an alternative, we propose a workflow and interface that allows users to quickly annotate jumps (by clicking on repeat signs), requiring a small amount of human supervision but yielding much higher quality alignments on average. Additionally, we refine audio and score feature representations to improve alignment quality by: (1) integrating measure detection into the score feature representation, and (2) using raw onset prediction probabilities from a music transcription model instead of piano roll. We propose an evaluation protocol for audio-to-score alignment that computes the distance between the estimated and ground truth alignment in units of measures.
